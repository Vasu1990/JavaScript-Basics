        // Here cityLocation() returns an object containing two closures – get() and set() – and they both refer to the outer variable city. 
        //get() obtains the current value of city, while set() updates it. When myLocation.get() is called for the second time,
        //it outputs the updated (current) value of city – “Bombay” – rather than the default “Delhi”.
        // So, closures can both read and update their stored variables, and the updates are visible to any closures that have access to them.
        //This means that closures store references to their outer variables, rather than copying their values.
